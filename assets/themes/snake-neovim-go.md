# Snake Theme: Neovim + Go

This profile uses a snake palette inspired by Neovim's dark UI and Go's signature cyan.

## Palette
- Snake head/body: `#00ADD8`
- Empty cells: `#0B1220`
- Activity levels: `#123026`, `#1F8B4C`, `#3FB950`, `#8BFF96`

## Rationale
- Deep slate/blue background keeps contrast high on GitHub dark mode.
- Go cyan gives strong motion focus to the snake.
- Green ladder mirrors contribution intensity naturally.
